## Results

A dashboard overview shows us some basic demographic information of the current users in NYC
* The number of rideshares for the year is 2.34 million
* Over 3/4 of the user base is subscribers
* Approximately 2/3 of the users are Male, 1/8 Female, and 1/4 are unidentified

The map below shows us where the users are taking their trips. The concentration of the trips are located in Manhattan. This makes sense and the area is one of the denses population areas in the world.  Many of the buildings are a mix of highrises for both commercial and residential uses.  This area is also known for its hotels and tourism.  This area is likely a best case scenario for bikesharing. 
* Large population of users
* Residents are likely living reletivly close to their work locations where they can utilize bikes
* Large amount of tourists that won't have their own way to commute

The graph below shows us that the majority of the trips have a duration under 20 mins with a distinct peak being only 4 - 8 minutes. This is an indication that the majority of people using the bikeshare program are using the bikes for shorter distances.  The shorter times are also indicative that the majority of people using bikes for longer durations, such as exercise, likely have their own bikes or use stationary bikes/classes.

A breakdown of the genders shows similiar curves for both males and females indicating similiar uses for both.

Below is a heatmap of when the trips are being taken.  There is a visible uptick on the weekdays in the morning and again in the evening.  These hotspots are when you would expect users to be commuting to and from work. This is indictating that the biggest use of the bikeshare program is being used for work commute.  In order for the program to be successful in other cities, we would likely need to see the average work commute in those cities with similar, shorter commutes.  The weekend shows  consistant usage throughtout the day starting between 9AM thru 7PM.  The second heatmap is a breakdown by gender.  We see similar hotspots for each gender with hotspots showing work commutes being the largest usage.

This final image is a daily breakdown of subscribers and non-subscribers, sorted by gender. Where we're seeing here is the subscribers having higher usage doing the weekdays, indicating they are the ones using bikesharing for work commutes. Non-subscribers are relatively consistant for the week.  This makes sense if the non-subscribers aren't using the program for work commuting.  Its likely the non-subscribers are made up of tourists and local people that can't bike to work.

## Summary

In conclusion, the bikeshare program is very popular in NYC. The majority of users are using the program for short commutes to work.  NYC offers and ideal scenario for this. NYC and Manhattan specifically, have a dense population where work sites and residential buildings are all around each other.  The population density provides some of the worst vehicle traffic in the U.S.   The bikeshare program offers and alternative and is viable as users are generally living within minutes of their workspace.

If the program were to be succesfull in Des Moines, IA.  It's likely we would need to further examine the average commute time and distance for that city.  Des Moines is the tourist destination that NYC is, but as the majority of bikeshare users are subscribers, this factor wouldn't exclude the bikesharing from being viable. Success will likely rely on if the citizens of Des Moines can back to and from work.
